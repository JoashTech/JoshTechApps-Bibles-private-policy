            <h3>📊 Data Flow Transparency (Applies to All Apps)</h3>
            <p><strong>Our Role:</strong> We enable third-party services that may collect anonymized data</p>
            <p><strong>Their Role:</strong> Third-party services independently collect and process device data</p>

            <h3>Important Note About Third-Party Services:</h3>
            <p>All our Bible apps use the same advertising networks and analytics services that may collect anonymized data independently. No user content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images) is accessed in ANY app. Please review their privacy policies:</p>

        <h2>1. Data Processing Overview (Identical Across All Apps)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising Services</strong>: ALL our Bible apps use the same advertising networks (Google AdMob, Unity Ads, Vungle/Liftoff) to display ads. These networks may collect anonymized device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID), IP address (for country-level targeting), device type, and ad interaction data. No app content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images) or SMS is accessed in ANY app. See their privacy policies:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob's Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Ads Privacy Policy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Policy</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Services</strong>: ALL apps use Firebase Analytics which may collect anonymized app usage data (e.g., screen views, button clicks, session duration) and device basics. No personal details or app content (e.g., quiz answers, notes) are collected, as outlined in <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reporting Services</strong>: ALL apps use Firebase Crashlytics which may collect anonymized crash reports (e.g., stack traces, device model, OS version) to improve stability. No user content or personal data is included, per <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: In ALL our Bible apps, notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, and customizations are stored locally on your device using Room persistence. This data is fully offline, not transmitted to our servers, and deleted upon app uninstall.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: If enabled in ANY of our apps' settings, we use device permissions to schedule daily verse/prayer reminders at 08:00 and 20:00. No content is tracked.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Initiated Actions</strong>: Shares of verses (e.g., images to social media, gallery, or SMS) in ANY app are handled by your device's sharing system and not collected or tracked by us.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information</strong>: We do not collect names, emails, exact locations, photos, files, or SMS in ANY of our Bible apps unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., via email contact).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Data Is Used (Same for All Apps)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Same ad networks use anonymized data to serve relevant ads and measure performance across all apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Same analytics services use data to help us understand user interactions and enhance features in all apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reporting</strong>: Same crash reporting services use data to identify and fix crashes for improved stability in all apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Data</strong>: Notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, and customizations provide personalized features within each app, stored offline identically across all apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Device permissions deliver user-configured daily reminders in each app where enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing (Identical for All Apps)</h2>
        <p>We do not share local data, user content (e.g., notes, highlights, shared images), notification preferences, or device files from ANY of our Bible apps with third parties. All apps use the same advertising and analytics partners which may collect and process anonymized data independently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: May share anonymized device identifiers and ad interactions with ad partners (<a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong>: Processes data for ad serving and analytics (<a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Vungle (Liftoff)</strong>: Uses data for ad targeting and measurement (<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics</strong>: Shares anonymized usage and crash data with Google (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy</a>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Choices (Apply to All Apps)</h2>
        <p>You have the following options regarding your data in ALL our Bible apps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opt out of personalized ads by resetting your Advertising ID or disabling personalized ads in your device's settings (e.g., Android Settings > Google > Ads). This affects all apps.</li>
            <li>Manage data collection through our partners' privacy controls or adjust your device's settings.</li>
            <li>Disable notifications in each app's settings or your device's notification settings.</li>
            <li>Delete local data by clearing each app's data through your device's settings or uninstalling the app.</li>
            <li>Manage user-initiated shares through your device's sharing permissions.</li>
            <li>Review and manage preferences through our partners' policies (applies to all apps):
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Controls</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Controls</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Privacy Controls</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention (Same for All Apps)</h2>
        <p>Local data (notes, favorite verses, quiz progress, highlights, customizations) in ANY of our Bible apps is retained on your device until you clear the app's data or uninstall it. We do not store personal data on our servers for ANY app. Third-party data is retained per their policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Data Retention</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Data Retention</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Vungle Data Retention</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy (Applies to All Apps)</h2>
        <p>ALL our Bible apps are rated E for Everyone and are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 in ANY of our apps. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Mobile Applications. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help us enforce this policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Mobile Applications. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it immediately. Please contact us if you have concerns regarding any of our apps.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Security (Identical for All Apps)</h2>
        <p>ALL our Bible apps rely on Android's built-in security features, such as app sandboxing, to protect local data stored on your device. Since no data from ANY app is transmitted to our servers, there is no risk of server-side data breaches. Our third-party partners implement their own security measures as described in their privacy policies, and these apply uniformly across all our apps.</p>

        <h2>8. International Compliance (Applies to All Apps)</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Union (GDPR) or California (CCPA), you may have additional rights, such as requesting data access or deletion. Since we only store data locally in ALL our apps and use third-party services for ads and analytics, you can exercise these rights through your device settings or our partners' privacy controls. Contact us for assistance with data subject requests for ANY of our Bible apps.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services (Same for All Apps)</h2>
        <p>ALL our Bible apps use the following identical third-party services that may collect anonymized data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> - Advertising network (used by all apps)</li>
            <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong> - Advertising network (used by all apps)</li>
            <li><strong>Vungle (Liftoff)</strong> - Advertising network (used by all apps)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> - Usage analytics (used by all apps)</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> - Crash reporting (used by all apps)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each service operates under its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review them. These same services are used identically across ALL our Bible applications.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Unified Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or third-party services. Updates will apply to ALL our Bible apps simultaneously. We will post the updated policy on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date, and your continued use of ANY of our Bible Apps constitutes consent to those changes.</p>
